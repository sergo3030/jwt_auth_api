# JWT Auth Project

**Please note**, this repo contains an ongoing project that's still in development. Some technological decisions were made based on prices and not efficiency and compatibility (since it is a stay-at-home-developer project).

Notes:
- Infrastructure that I provision with Terraform is not a final and most efficient solution, it was a first step. In general I want to move away from self-managed to serverless AWS architecture.
- I am still figuring out the best "secrets manager" solution for Git credentials, JWT keys and SQL credentials. Currently reading about [Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs?product_intent=vault).
